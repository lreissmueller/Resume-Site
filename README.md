# Resume Site Using Sass
 initially for CSULB BeachHacks 2021 - this is a SCSS presentation

**Required Software**  
You will need a Sass compiler to make the Sass part of this code work.  I use codekit (paid, mac only).  But, you could use Koala (free, all platforms).

You don't need to use the Sass to make this work, though.  It has CSS, too.

**Compiler?**  
A compiler will take the Sass and turn it into plain CSS.  Web browsers can read plain CSS, but not Sass.  Sass just makes organizing your project easier, and I find it helps speed up my dev time a bit.  Plus, its super dope, and all the cool web dev kids are doing it!

**What is this?**  
This is a ready to use, open-source, custom-built resume website.  Change all the things to make it your own.  It comes with no instructions, but you should be able to knock your way around it.

This site uses javascript, HTML and CSS (compiled from Sass), and includes some custom fonts.  Just open the html file and it should all appear working in your browser of choice.  Edit away to your heart's content!!!
